    "**Task 1: The \"Cold Outreach\" (Targeted Research)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scenario:** The user asks to draft an email to the CTO of \"CyberDyne Systems.\"\n",
    "* **The Test:**\n",
    "1. **Search CRM:** The agent *must* find the correct name (Bob Cyberdyne) and email from `contacts.csv`.\n",
    "2. **Product Knowledge:** It must reference the *specific features* from the Whitepaper (e.g., \"On-premise\", not \"Cloud\").\n",

    "* **Hard Gate (Pass/Fail):**\n",

    "* **The Test:**\n",
    "1. **Check Policy:** The agent must read `security_policy.md`.\n",
    "2. **Apply Logic:** The policy says: *\"Discounts > 15% require VP approval.\"*\n",
    "3. **Check Context:** *However*, the policy also says *\"Startups < $1M revenue get 20% off.\"* The agent must check `accounts.csv` to see Stark Industries' revenue ($8M).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hard Gate (Pass/Fail):**\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Scenario:** An RFP asks: *\"Do you offer 100% liability coverage and 24/7 support?\"*\n",
    "* **The Test:**\n",
    "1. **Read PDF:** Check `pricing_guide.pdf` for support tiers. (Enterprise tier has 24/7 support).\n",
    "2. **Read Policy:** Check `security_policy.md` regarding liability. (Policy explicitly says *\"NEVER agree to unlimited liability\"*).\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Hard Gate (Pass/Fail):**\n",

    "* **Scenario:** Read the messy transcript `meeting_004.txt` (Oscorp churn risk).\n",
    "* **The Test:**\n",
    "1. **Identify Issue:** The client is threatening to churn unless they get \"Legacy Support\" for free.\n",
    "2. **Identify Product:** \"Legacy Support\" is a specific SKU in the PDF (`AI-S-ADD`, $15k).\n",
